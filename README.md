As an economist at world trade/bank organization, we will be working with the country wise statistics to get the different correlation variables. For an economy, its overall performance is shown by the indicators such as national income, happinesss, score, corruption level, generosity score. It is important to determine how these variables are related to each other for economics and other ways. For example, if a lower level of corruption is followed by a higher income, it would sugest the government to work onthese factors. To do so , we will be working with two dataset: climate and national income indicators;




Following are the questions that we would look to answer

### National Indicators

* Is there significant relationship between happiness score and gdp per capita?

* Is there significant relationship between generosity and income

* Is there significant relationship between income and corruption?


### Climate Change:


* Is there significant difference in mean tempersture chnage over the decade?



* Is there a significance difference in temperature change for different continents.

The given analysis conveys the following insights for the business:


* Although the world has been focussing more on global warming issue, it needs to be more awared and take more steps to the current alarming situation.


* Some continents are facing more of global warming (such as Europe). These continents or groups of nations must be more involved in activities/ plans that help in countering the global warming problem.


* Happiness of a nation is highly correlated with factors  such as income per capita. So focussing on factors impacting income such as corruption will have a positive impact on the happiness level of an economy.
